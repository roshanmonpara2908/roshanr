            <img src="paris.jpg" class="image">
            <p>Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. <br><hr> People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bce. <br><hr> The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine. <br><hr>
                In its location on the western side of Europe and in a plain relatively close to the sea, Paris benefits from the balmy influences of the Gulf Stream and has a fairly temperate climate. <br><hr> The weather can be very changeable, however, especially in winter and spring, when the wind can be sharp and cold. <br><hr> The annual average temperature is in the lower 50s F (roughly 12 °C); the July average is in the upper 60s F (about 19 °C), and the January average is in the upper 30s F (about 3 °C).<br><hr> </p>
